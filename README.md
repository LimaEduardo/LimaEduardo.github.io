# scoreboard-vuejs
Web interface to interact with the scoreboarding algorithm 

## Getting Started
To run this web app it's necessary an API to send the information and get back the results. This repository is only an interface.

This interface was built to run with [Michel Wan Der Maas API](https://github.com/michelwandermaas/trabalho_ARQ)  (Used by default)

## Running
Just open index.html in your favorite browser and fill the form with number of instructions, instructions and the latencies.

If necessary, change the api link in the variable "apiLink" at app.js
